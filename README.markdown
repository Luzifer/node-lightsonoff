= The Idea =

The idea it that everyone takes their cellphone with them when they are leaving the house. This daemon watches the syslog on the DHCP server to log the last DHCPREQUEST sent by the cellphone while in the WiFi. If there is no request since n seconds one or more signals are sent to the EZcontrol box to switch off the lights.
